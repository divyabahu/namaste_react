                    (building our own create react app)
react is the core package and react dom is the package which is manupulating dom.
react dom means the web version of the react.
react is fast due to the virtual dom
react uses parcel and parcel uses lots of other dependencies


=>npm init=>it will provide package.json
=>npm i -D parcel(-D means dev dependency)=> node modules and package lock are provided
    parcel uses lot of things to optimise your application
    it is basically containing all the dependencies
    package lock is a very imp file it locks the version  so we didnt need to put it in git ignore
    package lock take care that the version which is running on system is same as the version running on server
    package lock will help us to generate our node modules on our server

=>npm install(gives us node modules)
=>npm install react
=>npm install react-dom
=>npx parcel index.html(npx means execute using npm) gives us dist folder
    after installing react and react dom import both of them in app.js file
    never edit node modules and package lock
    for resolving the error given by parcel edit script tag in index.html as(<script type="module" src="App.js"></script>)
    hot module reload will automatically implement the changes when you save your code
=>npx parcel build index.html(in this index.html is the entry point of our application)
    remove main:"app.js if it gives error"
    parcel is a bundler.it does minification.parcel also removes console log and sve the code on dist folder
    parcel also cleans our code,parcel does image optimization also,parcel also does caching by development.
    parcel gives us functionality to enable https on our local build
    parcel manages port nos
    bebble is a dependency for parcel and parcel is the dependency for react
    parcel doesnot need any kind of configuration
    transitive dependencies are responsible to do all the above stuff handeled by parcel
    parcel use3s consistent hashing algorithm to do all the bundling
    we should put .parcel-cache in our git ignore
    any thing which we can generate on server we can put inside gitignore

    INSERT BROWSERS LIST IN PACKAGE.JSON
    BROWSER LIST MAKE THE application compatible for all the other BROWSERS
     "last 2 versions" /*the application is compatible with the last 2 versions of all the browsers */
     "last 2 chrome versions" /*in this the compiler will make sure that the application is working on the last two versions of crome only*/
